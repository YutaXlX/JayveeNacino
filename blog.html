            <h2>Our Certificate & Programs</h2>
            <p> Kolehiyo ng Subic, or known as KNS, is the first community college in the province of Zambales. 
                Mayor Jeffrey D. Khonghun, the President Emeritus, is the acknowledged founder and father of the school. 
                With the spirit and fervor of the pioneering members of the faculty, the clamor of the Subiqueños to have a college of 
                their own was realized. KNS is primarily built and meant for poor students. When the good mayor assumed office in 2001, 
                one of his administration’s development pillars is focused on the improvement of education. </p>
                <br>
                <p> The future of the youth was not so promising during that time as Subiqueños find difficulty in acquiring decent and stable jobs
                 after graduating from high school. It was a disheartening experience for the mayor to see his constituents turned down for 
                 employment due to academic deficiency. This sad experience led the mayor to entertain thoughts to start a community college.
                  Hence, consultation with the department heads and researches were done, resulting to that bold dream of establishing a local
                college. </p>
                <br>
                <p>The school operations would require professionals and so, the Board of Trustees was formed. “Pamantasan ng Subic” was created and operated 
                as a special project under the Mayor’s Office. Immediately after the enactment of the Ordinance, the Board of Trustees was convened and 
                compositions, functions and appointments were stipulated in an Executive Order. To ensure its sustainability, the funding of the college 
                was appropriated under the Mandatory Operating and Other Expenses (MOOE) of the municipality’s fund. The community college “Pamantasan ng 
                Subic” was established through Regulatory Ordinance No. 2002-05 enacted by the Sangguniang Bayan of Subic, Zambales last September, 2002 at 
                Subic Municipal Hall under the administration of former Mayor Jeffrey D. Khonghun.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After some deliberations between the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the Sangguniang Bayan of this municipality, 
                Regulatory Ordinance NO. 2002-06 was enacted last November 20, 2002 at Subic Municipal Hall that has the provision of changing 
                the college’s name from “Pamantasan ng Subic” to “Kolehiyo ng Subic.” It was Mayor Jeffrey D. Khonghun who thought of the name 
                “Kolehiyo ng Subic.” The pioneering themselves conducted high school visitation and rode bancas just to inform potential 
                enrollees. The people of Subic were at first hesitant and wary of suhh a huge project.</p>
                <br>
                <p>On 2003-2004, the first batch of Kolehiyo Ng Subic students stayed at FDO building located at Sta. Monica Subdivision, 
                Brgy. Sto. Tomas for two years. The courses offered were Bachelor in Elementary Education (BEED), 
                Bachelor in Secondary Education (BSED), Bachelor of Science in Accountancy (BSA), 
                Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA) and Bachelor of Arts in Social Science (BASS). 
                The number of students was around 300. In 2004, Kolehiyo Ng Subic found a home in 
                Brgy. Wawandue, Subic, Zambales. TESDA courses were added: Computer Programming (ComProg), Computer Secretarial (ComSec), 
                Computer Technician (ComTech) and Tourism and Restaurant Management Operations (TRHO).</p>
                <br>
                <p>Initially, ten new classrooms, a computer and TRHO laboratory, a library and a separate building for the administration were 
                constructed. Another additional thirteen classrooms followed and the school stage was built. Indeed, more conducive compared 
                to the rented campus at Brgy. Sto. Tomas. The stability of Kolehiyo ng Subic was further strengthened as the next Mayors of 
                Subic, Mayor Jay Khonghun and Mayor Jonathan John Khonghun, envision the school in a more lasting perspective. They firmly 
                believe that it would be more beneficial for Subic to invest on education because the “return of investment” will be more 
                enduring with educated and skilled constituents.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Truly the fulfillment of the founder’s vision of “Giving Access to Quality Education for All” 
                in consonance with DepEd objective Education for All (EFA) in 2015. First, a dream. Then, a vision. Now,
                a reality. Kolehiyo ng Subic, established in 2002. </p>
